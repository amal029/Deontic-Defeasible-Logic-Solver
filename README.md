  * This is a solver for Deontic Defeasible Logic programs.
	1. The solver is written in C++ (std C++-17).
	2. The solver can be compiled using: ``g++-m -O3 -Werror -Wall
	-Wpedantic -std=c++17 solver.cpp -o solver && ./solver``
    3. The example is written in the main function.
* TODO:
    1. Need to write a parser for taking inputs from the user in some
       format.
    2. Taking input from LegalRuleML.
